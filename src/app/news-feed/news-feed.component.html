        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Causes</h3>
        <p class="my-6 dark:text-gray-600">
          The cause of most bone cancers isn't known. Bone cancer starts when
          cells in or near a bone develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA
          holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy
          cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate.
          The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells,
          the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the
          cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep
          living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The
          cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to
          invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can
          break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads,
          it's called metastatic cancer.

            <strong>Inherited Genetic Syndromes:</strong>  
            Certain rare genetic syndromes passed through families increase the risk of bone cancer.  
            Examples include:
            <ul class="list-inside list-[circle] pl-4">
              <li>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</li>
              <li>Hereditary retinoblastoma</li>

          </li>
    
          <li>
            <strong>Other Bone Conditions:</strong>  
            Some conditions that may increase the risk of bone cancer include:
            <ul class="list-inside list-[circle] pl-4">
              <li>Paget's disease of bone</li>
              <li>Fibrous dysplasia</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
    
          <li>
            <strong>Cancer Treatment:</strong>  
            Radiation therapy for cancer and certain chemotherapy medicines may increase the risk of bone cancer.
